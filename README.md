# stack-tainer-splitrun

An Apptainer sif image with ECDC data pipeline binaries and splitrun utilities.

## Developer notes
Built on top of [stack-tainer-ecdc](https://github.com/g5t/stack-tainer-ecdc).
The image version of both is set by the released repository commit tag, so this repository tag must match the one in `stack-tainer-ecdc`.
