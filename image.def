Data collection utilities for the European Spallation Source.
Event Formation Unit binaries:
	bifrost  - the indirect geometry time-of-flight spectrometer, BIFROST
	cbm      - beam monitors used a multiple instruments
	cspec    - the direct geometry time-of-flight spectrometer, CSPEC
	dream    - the powder diffractometer, DREAM
	freia    - the reflectometer, FREIA
	loki     - the small angle scattering diffractometer, LOKI
	miracles - the back scattering time-of-flight spectrometer, MIRACLES
	nmx      - the macromollecular single crystal diffractometer, NMX
	timepix3 - the TimePix3 clustering photon imaging detector, used at ODIN
	trex     - the direct geometry time-of-flight spectrometer, TREX
File Writer binaries:
	kafkfa-to-nexus - the worker responsible for writing streams to NeXus files
McCode Plumber programs:
	mc-epics              - Configure and run an EPICS mailbox server to host instrument setting parameter value updates 
	mp-epics-update       - Send 'key value' pair updates to a running EPICS mailbox server
	mp-forwarder-setup    - Inform the Forwarder which instrument setting parameters should be forwarded to Kafka
	mp-forwarder-teardown - Inform the Forwarder to stop sending instrument setting parameter updates
	mp-insert-hdf5-instr  - Add a serialized form of the provided instrument to a new or existing HDF5 file
	mp-register-topics    - Ensure that the specified stream topic names exist on a configurable Kafka service
	mp-splitrun           - Use 'restage.splitrun' with McCode histogram (monitor) sending callbacks for Kafka integration
	mp-writer-from        - Print the current time as needed to specify, e.g., the start time in a call to 'mp-writer-write'
	mp-writer-kill        - Send a File Writer command to stop a specified job
	mp-writer-killall     - Send a File Writer command to stop all jobs
	mp-writer-list        - List known File Writer jobs
	mp-writer-wait        - Sleep until the specified File Writer job has finished
	mp-writer-write       - Send a File Writer command to start a job, controlling start and optionally stop time
Utilities:
	launch-writer    - create a new kafka-to-nexus file writer, optionally using some sensible defaults
	launch-forwarder - create a EPICS to Kafka forwarder, optionally using some sensible defaults
